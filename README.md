> Read the files from your build

## Why?

 - Know what is in your build and where it is.
 - Useful to send the build to external services.
 - Agnostic of how the files were written.

## Install

```sh
npm install build-files --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const buildFiles = require('build-files');
```

Get a list of the files within the most recent build.

```js
buildFiles.latest().then((files) => {
    console.log('files:', files);
    // [
    //     {
    //         path    : 'master/1.0.0/foo.js',
    //         content : 'This is foo.'
    //     }
    // ]
});
```
