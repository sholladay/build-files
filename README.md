> Read the files from your build.

## Why?

 - Useful to send the build to external services.
 - Agnostic of how the files were written.

```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

const buildFiles = require('build-files');
```

Get a list of the files within the latest build.

    console.log('files:', files);
});
```
